      <h2> About the author </h2>
        <p> Hello viewers! My name is Presley George and I am a Sophomore at Illinois Institute of technology studying Computer Science. I am an international student coming from the United Arab Emirates. I can read and write or speak five languages: English, French, Arabic, Hindi and Tamil. I am very much intrested in cyber security and would like to join a company to help protect my company's computer networks and systems. I am looking forward to mastering html and the other scripting languages by the end of this course and have a website setup for my blog if I decide to make one. </p>
